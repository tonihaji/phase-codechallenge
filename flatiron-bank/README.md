Bank of Flatiron
Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial data! Use the below gif as an example of how the app should function.


Instructions
For this project, you’ll be building out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.

Requirements
For this project, you must:

Have a well-written README file.
Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.
Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data
In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this data Links to an external site.for your server DB.
Run this command to get the backend started:
json-server --watch db.json

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:
http://localhost:8001/transactions

Project Setup
Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

Create a new project folder
Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes. We promise we won't steal your code)
Please make sure you regularly commit to the repository.
If you are unfamiliar with HTML tables, take a look at the docs with an example hereLinks to an external site.

Endpoints
The base URL for your backend is: http://localhost:8001

Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

See a table of the transactions.
Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table as well as post the new transaction to the backend API for persistence.
Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
